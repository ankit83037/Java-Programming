Expected Completion Time  : 45 mins



Hy Fy mobiles is a famous mobile showroom in the city. The detail of every mobile in their showroom is available in their database. The showroom wants to give the customers the facility to view the product id and the price of mobiles that falls within a particular price range.

You being their software consultant have been approached to develop an application which can be used for managing their business. You need to implement a Java program to view the product id and the price of all the mobiles based on the range.

Component Specification: Mobile(Model Class)

Type(Class)    Attributes        Methods

Mobile       int productId
             String brandName
             String modelName
             String memory
             int price
             String colour

Note: Appropriate public getters,setters and a six argument constructor in the given order - productId, brandName, modelName, memory,price,colour are provided as a part of the code template.

Requirement 1: Retrieve the product id and the price of mobiles within the given price range

The customer should have the facility to view the product id and price of mobiles which falls within a particular price range. Hence the system should fetch the product id and price of all the mobiles for the given range from the database. The product id and the price of those mobiles should be added to a Map<Integer, Integer>. Product id as a key along with price as a value. Sort the Map based on the price and return the same.

Component Specification:MobileManagementSystem

Component Name                                    Type(Class)  Attributes                Methods                                                                                   Responsibilities

Retrieve the product id and price of mobiles  MobileManagementSystem   public Map<Integer, Integer> viewMobileWithInTheRange(int minRange,int maxRange)   This method should accept a minimumRange and maximumRange as parameter and retrieve the product id and price of the mobiles with the given range in the database. Add these details in Map<Integer, Integer>. Product id as a key along with price 
which fall within a particular price range.                                                                                                               as a value and sort the Map based on the price. Return the sorted Map.
     

Note: The class and methods should be declared as public and all the attributes should be declared as private.

The mobile table is already created at the backend. The structure of the mobile table is as follows:

Column Name          Datatype

productId            int

brandName            varchar(30)

modelName            varchar(30)

memory               varchar(10)

price                int

colour               varchar(30)

Sample records available in the mobile table are as shown below:

productId    brandName   modelName  memory  price   colour

104          Redmi       Note7Pro   128GB   11999   Nebula Red/Black/Neptune Blue

146          Lenovo      K9         32GB    5999    Black/Blue

951          Samsung     A50        64GB    20999   Black/White/Blue

964          Samsung     S9         128GB   61900   Black/Coral Blue/Lilac Purple

To connect to the database you are provided with the database.properties file and the DB.java file.(Do not change any values in the database.properties file)

Create a class called Main with the main method and get the inputs like minimumvalue and maximumvalue from the user.

Display the productId and price for all the mobiles returned as Map<Integer, Integer> from the method viewMobileWithInTheRange in the MobileManagementSystem class.

If no mobile is available in the list, the output should be "No mobiles found for the given range".

Note:

In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user and the rest of the text represents the output.

Ensure to follow the object oriented specifications provided in the question description.
Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes and methods as specified in the question.

The following Sample Inputs / Outputs are generated based on the above mentioned Sample records given in the mobile table.

Adhere to the code template, if provided.
Assume that the value of the minimum range is always less than the value of the maximum range.

Sample Input / Output 1:

Enter the minimum range

5000

Enter the maximum range

20000

146:5999

104:11999

Sample Input / Output 2:

Enter the minimum range

65000

Enter the maximum range

75000

No mobiles found for the given range
